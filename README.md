# How To Make a Simple Line Chart With AmCharts Version 5

This is just a example use case of Amcharts v5 for showing simple data in charts.

Dependencies
  1. jQuery ( latest version - Included )
  2. For this specific chart - Animated.js - index.js - xy.js ( Included )

Notes
  - You can provide your own data (json) as shown in scripts.js file but I used only generated json for demonstrating the output chart.
  - The whole project was on Windows File System for practicing ( You have to change file paths in index.html file if you use it anywhere else )
